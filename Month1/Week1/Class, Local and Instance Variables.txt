CLASS VARIABLES, INSTANCE VARIABLES AND LOCAL VARIABLES IN JAVA
	A variable is the name of a reserved area allocated in memory. In other words, it is a name of the memory location. It is a combination of "vary + able" which means its value can be changed.Based on scope in which a variable is declared, we classify them as class, instance and local variables.
i) Class Variables:
--> They are also known as static variables, as they are declared using a static keyword. 
--> They are declared inside a class but outside of all methods.
--> They belong to class and are common to all the objects in a class.
Example: 
class MyClass{
static int myVar;}
ii) Instance Variables:
--> Instance variables are non-static variables and are defined in a class outside any methods.
--> These variables are specific to each instance (object) of the class.
Example: 
 class MyClass {
 int myVar;}
      iii) Local Variables:
-->Local variables are variables defined within methods or blocks in a class.
--> Local variables are declared the same way as instance variables, except that they are declared within a method or block. Their scope is limited to that only, and have no existence outside the block.
--> Unlike static or instance variables, local variables are not initialized by JVM with a default value. Hence, a local variable must be initialized before we try to use it. 

Example 1:
	class A{
		static int b=10;				//Static variable or class variable 
		void func(){
		      int n=90; }				// local variable 
		public static void main(String args[]){
		     int c= 30; 				//instance variable 
		}}

Example 2:
	public class VariableExample{
	int a;						// instance variable
  	 static int b = 50;					//class variable
   	public static void main(String args[]){
     		 int c = 1000;				//local variable 
      		VariableExample obj = new VariableExample();
     		 System.out.println("Value of instance variable : "+obj.a);
     		 System.out.println("Value of static variable : "+VariableExample.b);
      		System.out.println("Value of local variable: "+c);
   }}

Output
Value of instance variable a: 0
Value of static variable b: 50
Value of local variable c: 1000
