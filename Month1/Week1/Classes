-> Class is the collection of objects which have similar kind of properties.

-> It is also called a blueprint through which objects are created.

-> Another fact about classes is that it doesn't occupy any memory as it is only the logical unit, not a physical one.

-> Classes are of two major types:
1. Pre-defined classes:- These are the classes that are already defined in java, that is, they already have their logic and codes written and we cannot change them. We can only use them by importing those classes. For example: Scanner, String, etc.

2. User defined classes:- These are the type of classes which a user itself creates and is responsible for all the logic and functioning of that class. For example: Calculate, account, etc.

-> But class always go hand in hand with a java object. So, an object is also called an instance of the class. It is a real world entity with mainly three characteristics:
  i) State: it means the value of the object
  
 ii) Behaviour: It means functioning of the object

iii) Identity: it is a unique id used internally by JVM.
